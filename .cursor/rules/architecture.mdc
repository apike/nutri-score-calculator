# Project Architecture

- This project uses Svelte 5 in Runes mode and SvelteKit 2 and runs as an SPA
  - This means no React in this project
  - This also means event handkers use the syntax `onclick`, not `on:click`
- Packages use `pnpm`, not `npm`
- CSS is built with TailwindCSS 4 and DaisyUI 5
- Keep things simple, always ask before proposing a new npm package
